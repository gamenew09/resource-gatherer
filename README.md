# Resource Gatherer
A Source Engine modification that attempts to extend on the Resource Collector prototype released in the "Half-Life 2: Aftermath" mod.

> This modification is currently VERY barebones. There is no substantial gameplay yet. Probably best to wait until there is a bit of gameplay.

## Compiling
Generate the game projects and compile the solution generated. Then copy the `resourcegatherer` folder to Steam's sourcemods folder. Make sure you restart to have it appear in your game library.
